# graph-git-doc

Analyze git repo of _Project Unicorn_ manuscript, and graph daily word
count and the lines changed in the generated Markdown manuscript.

This program uses as input:

- [clj-jgit](https://github.com/clj-jgit/clj-jgit) library to get list of all commit hashes
- [archaeologist](https://github.com/wildbit/archaeologist) library to get file versions at each commit (to get number of lines)
- output of `git log --patch-with-stat --unified=1 manuscript.mmd` to get list of all lines changed upon each commit
- exported daily work log in CSV format

This program uses the fantastic [oz](https://github.com/metasoarous/oz) library to generate the vega-lite diagrams.

Next iteration tries to show adds/modifies/deletes:

## Usage

- go into ozdemo namespace
- in REPL, run `(oz/v! (composite-graph))`

Honestly, I'm publishing this just so people can see
how to use these fantastic libraries.

Requires clojure 1.10, as 1.11 breaks some of the libraries
